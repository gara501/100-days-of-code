# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Macro calculator definition, stack to use: angular 1.4, firebase, gulp, SASS.

**Thoughts:** the idea is to practice with this specific version of angular because I need to work with that in my job, so, I will start again a new project to implement the basic things, models, views, directives, etc.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)
