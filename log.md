**Today's Progress**: API Fitness functions in NPM version 1

**Thoughts:** I want to create a new APP to generate macronutrients intake calculations and other fitness formulas, for now I'm generating an API in NPM to use it in my next app.

**Link to work:** [Soul4API App]  (https://www.npmjs.com/package/soul4api)

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Calculate your BMI]()
2. [Calculate your macronutrients]()
